# winevent2logstash

This is a modified version of evt2ls.ps, a Powershell script that grabs event logs and pushes them to a logstash.  The original work was done by:

# Feel free to use the code but please share the changes you've made

Mad props, Xavier.  Anyway, I made changes, and now I'm sharing them.
